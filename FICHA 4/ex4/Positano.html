    <h1>Positano</h1>
    <p>Positano, nestled along Italy's Amalfi Coast, is a picturesque paradise where azure skies meet the shimmering Tyrrhenian Sea. This charming cliffside village is a postcard-perfect destination, with its pastel-hued buildings tumbling down the steep slopes like a cascade of candy-colored jewels. Meandering cobblestone streets reveal hidden gems, from quaint boutiques to inviting trattorias serving delectable Mediterranean cuisine.</p>
